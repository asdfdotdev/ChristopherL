/* THANKS */
The ChristopherL team - Mom would be proud
Panic - Without whom we'd have to scp everything, and that sucks
Rasmus Lerdorf - Without whom we'd probably be working with Ruby, or, worse, C#
JetBrains - The second best thing from Czech Republic (behind Pilsner Urquell)
Sweden - Home of the worlds greatest RDBMS and furniture
The Annex - The finest team, within the finest team, we've ever worked with, probably
Brian Fox - One of our personal heros
Specialized - Bike commuting ftw
Pabst Blue Ribbon - Our best code is fueled by these guys
